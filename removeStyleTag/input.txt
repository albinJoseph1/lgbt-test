<p><strong>ABOUT HMP HUNTERCOMBE</strong></p>

<p>HMP Huntercombe opened as a prison in 1946, originally built as an internment camp during the last war, when for a short period it held Rudolf Hess, on his way south after he famously parachuted into Scotland. Extensive redevelopment has taken place over the last twenty years and there is little left of the wartime buildings.<br />
Currently Huntercombe is a Category C adult male establishment holding a solely foreign national population in order to support government priorities on the deportation of foreign national offenders. Courses delivered within the prison include: English, Maths, ICT, P&amp;D, Barbering, Construction, Hospitality, Art and ESOL.<br />
<br />
The education department working day is from 7.50am &ndash; 4.40pm Monday &ndash; Thursday &amp; 7.50am-12.35pm Friday</p>
